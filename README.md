# Apollo codegen JSDoc demo

Apollo tooling can automatically generate typings based on your GraphQL schema. This is a quick demo to explore the possibilities to leverage these typings and typescript, but while writing the app in plain JS with JSDoc.

This repo includes only the client using Next.js, you will need the apollo server from https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial running on `http://localhost:4000`.
